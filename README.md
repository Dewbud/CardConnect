# PHP CardConnect Adapter

## Initializing
```php
$merchant_id = '123456123456';
$user        = 'username';
$pass        = 'password';
$server      = 'https://sub.domain.tld:1111/';

$client = new CardPointe($merchant_id, $user, $pass, $server);
```

## Testing Credentials
```php
$boolean = $client->testAuth();
```

## Validate Merchant ID
```php
$boolean = $client->validateMerchantId();
```

## Tweaks
Responses are parsed and their amount fields are returned in cents ```int```.

The client stores the last request made as an ```array``` ```$client->last_request``` which can be used to debug requests

## Response Objects
Responses are returned as objects and can be accessed as arrays.
```php
$response = $client->inquire($retref);
$response->amount; // returns int
$response->toJSON(); // Returns JSON encoded string, accepts format codes (JSON_PRETTY_PRINT, etc)
$response->toArray(); // Returns array of attributes
```

## Authorizing Transactions
```php
$authorization_response = $client->authorize([
    'account' => '4242424242424242',
    'amount'  => '100',
    'expiry'  => '0120',
]);
```

**You can also authorize and capture in the same request like so**
```php
$capture_response = $client->authorize([
    'account' => '4242424242424242',
    'amount'  => '100',
    'expiry'  => '0120',
    'capture' => 'Y',
]);
```

## Tests
```composer test```

Note: small or large authorization/capture amounts don't seem to work with the test merchant credentials.

## Future stuff
Implement remains service endpoints
- Funding Service
- Signature Capture Service (probably never)
- Open Batch Service
- Close Batch Service
- BIN Service
